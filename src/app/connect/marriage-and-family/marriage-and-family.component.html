  Marriage and family are God’s design and a reflection of His covenant love for His people. At our church, we seek to strengthen
  marriages and families through biblical teaching, counselling, fellowship, and prayer. We believe that when Christ is at the center
  of the home, love, peace, and joy overflow into every relationship.

  Our Marriage and Family ministry supports couples, parents, and children through workshops, family enrichment programs, and
  mentorship opportunities. These gatherings encourage spiritual growth, effective communication, forgiveness, and godly leadership
  within the home.

  The foundation for a godly family is found in <b>Ephesians 5:21-33, Colossians 3:18-21, Psalm 127:1, and Proverbs 22:6</b>.
