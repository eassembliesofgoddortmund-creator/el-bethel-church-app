<p class="justify-text">
  Marriage restoration is focused on helping couples overcome challenges, conflicts, or separation by applying biblical principles
  and the power of prayer. Through counselling, prayer sessions, and workshops, couples are guided to restore trust, forgiveness,
  and love in their marriages.

  In this ministry, couples are encouraged to confront issues with humility, communicate openly, and seek God’s guidance in every
  decision. The sessions also provide tools for conflict resolution, emotional healing, and spiritual growth together. Our
  ultimate goal is to see marriages reconciled, strengthened, and centered on Christ.

  The scriptural foundation for marriage restoration can be found in <b>Matthew 19:6, Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 3:13, 1 Peter 4:8, and James 5:16</b>.
