<p class="justify-text">
  Premarital counselling is designed to prepare couples for a lifelong, God-centered marriage. Through these sessions,
  couples are guided on communication, conflict resolution, spiritual growth, and understanding the biblical roles
  and responsibilities within marriage. Our goal is to help couples grow closer to each other and to God as they
  enter this sacred covenant.

  In these counselling sessions, couples are encouraged to pray together, discuss expectations, and learn practical
  ways to maintain love, respect, and unity. The counselling also emphasizes the importance of putting Christ at
  the center of the marriage, ensuring a relationship that thrives on mutual trust, faith, and forgiveness.

  The scriptural foundation for premarital guidance can be found in <b>Ephesians 5:22-33, 1 Corinthians 13:4-7, Colossians 3:12-17, and Proverbs 18:22</b>.
